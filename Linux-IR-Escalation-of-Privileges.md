## Scenario

Company A has been noticing some PII information about employees might be getting leaked because of recent phishing attempts that have been perpetrated. Such information includes address, email address, and phone number. All of this information is stored on a linux server as a hidden file where only the root/sudo users have read and write access. There was a report by another employee the other day of a fellow employee messing with the computer while the root administrator was in the bathroom. The company has decided to investigate this.
